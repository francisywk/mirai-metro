The **Mirai Metro** ([Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 美拉地鐵, [Cantonese Yale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Cantonese "Yale romanization of Cantonese"): *Méihlāai Deihtit*), formerly known as [Mirai RGB](/wiki/Mirai-RGB "Mirai RGB"), is a [rapid transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit "Rapid transit") system serving [City of Mirai](/wiki/Mirai "Mirai"), [United Cities](/wiki/United-Cities "United Cities"). It is operated by [CART Corporation](/wiki/CART-Corporation "CART Corporation"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ministry of Transport (MoT) of Government of the United Cities. Opened in 2015, Mirai Metro is the first and oldest public transit system in the United Cities. It is operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Before Mirai Metro underwent rapid expansion, the network only consists of three lines which gave the metro its former name, the Mirai RGB as it is made up of the Red, Green, and Blue lines. Together with the [Mirai Regional Railway](/wiki/Mirai-Regional-Railway "Mirai Regional Railway"), the metro provides urban rail transportation service for the nation's capital.

#### History

---

- 7 June 2015 – Mirai RGB started operation with Zero Zero to Paradise Falls section of Blue Line enters service.
- 5 October 2019 – Hell Gate [infill station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infill_station "Infill sttaion") was opened on the Blue Line between Zero Zero and Spawn.

#### Infrastructure

---

###### **Network**

Mirai Metro is made up of 8 lines that are currently operational on 8.1 kilometres (5.1 miles) of tracks. All lines on the network are manual operation lines except the Diamond Line, which is an automated line. An automated line requires no further input from the passengers after they have selected the travel direction. The minecart will stop at the station for a few seconds before launching the minecart along with the passenger to the following station in the same direction.

The lines are ordered based on the time that the lines are opened. Oldest lines are listed first, before newer lines with the exception of the original RGB lines and the medium-capacity Diamond line. The Blue Line is actually the first line to be built on the metro followed by Red Line.
