The **Diamond Line** (Code **D**), previously known as the Mirai SkyCart, is a [rapid transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit "Rapid transit") line of [Mirai Metro](/wiki/mirai-metro "Mirai Metro") servicing Mirai, United Cities. It is the fourth rail transit line and the first [fully automated and control-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_train_operation "Automatic train operation") rail system in the United Cities. The line is coloured **<span class="text-dl">Light Blue</span>** on the official network map.

Prior to the extension to {{< wiki/link station="Diamond Hill" >}} station, the line was entirely elevated and was the only one in the system that did so.

#### History

---

##### Mirai SkyCart

The Diamond Line was previously called the Mirai SkyCart. Owned and operated by the Mirai SkyCart Company, the system was opened on 8 March 2017, making it the second system and the fourth railway transit line to enter service in the United Cities. The system was not a part of the then [Mirai RGB](/wiki/mirai-rgb "Mirai RGB") system, it was operated as an independent and separated network instead.

The initial route features 4 stations spanned from {{< wiki/link station="Berryhills" >}} to {{< wiki/link station="Downtown East" >}}.

<br>

##### Merging with Mirai RGB

<br>

##### Line extension

In 2019, Diamond Line was extended northward to {{< wiki/link station="UCHQ North" >}} and southward to {{< wiki/link station="Diamond Hill" >}}, and was opened on 1 April 2019 and 1 May 2019 respectively. 

<br>

##### Conversion to automatic operation

As part of the extension project, the line was also converted to [fully automated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_train_operation "Automatic train operation") operation. The automation system deployed is a custom [command](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands "Commands") system inspired and modified from FlashTeens [Minecart Railway Builder Tool](https://github.com/flashteens/FTMCRailBuilder13) datapack.

With the use of [Command Block](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block "Command Block"), riders can choose the desired heading direction before taking the train, and the [minecart](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecart "Minecart") will be launched automatically heading the selected direction (either north, south, east, or west).

<br>

#### Station themes

---

Each station of the Diamond Line with the exception of Mirai and Diamond Hill stations features a unique theme.
